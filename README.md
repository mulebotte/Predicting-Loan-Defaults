# Predicting-Loan-Defaults

Decision Trees, Logistic Regressions, and Random Forests are used to predict loan defaults with SKLearn in python.

The dataset used is a information on loans gathered by the LendingClub. Out of ~10,000 entries, there were roughly 1,500 defaults. I used the machine learning
library Sklearn to predict which loans had not been paid back, using three separate strategeies.

This project is a 'Classification Problem', as the outcome being predicted is one of several finite outcomes. Classification problems are usually solved 
using logistic regressions, decision trees, or random forests. I will use all three strategies to find which one works best in this situation.
